Text Classification with TensorFlow
This repository contains code for a text classification project using TensorFlow and scikit-learn. The project focuses on training a neural network model to classify text data into multiple categories.

Overview
In this project, we leverage TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training a neural network model. The model architecture consists of an input layer and a single dense layer with a sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification tasks. We utilize scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation of the model's performance.

Key Features
TensorFlow Model Training: Train a neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
Evaluation: Compute training accuracy and make predictions on test data.
Data Preprocessing: Convert sparse feature matrices to dense matrices before model training.
Customization: Modify model architecture and parameters to suit specific classification tasks.
