#Description:
This repository contains a Python script for a machine learning project that utilizes TensorFlow and scikit-learn libraries for text classification tasks. The code snippet focuses on training a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API and evaluating its performance on a multi-label classification problem.

#Key Features:
TensorFlow Model Training: The script trains a neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API. The model consists of an input layer and a single dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

#Evaluation:
After training the model, it computes the training accuracy and makes predictions on the test dataset. The accuracy is measured using scikit-learn's accuracy_score function.

#Data Preprocessing:
It converts sparse feature matrices (X_vec and test_X_vec) to dense matrices (X_vec_dense and test_X_vec_dense) before model training.

#Usage:
Ensure TensorFlow and scikit-learn libraries are installed (pip install tensorflow scikit-learn).
Define the TensorFlow model architecture and compilation parameters.
Train the model using the training data (train_df) and evaluate its performance.
Make predictions on the test dataset (test_X_vec) and store the results.

#Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
Note: This code is part of a larger machine learning project and may require additional preprocessing steps, data loading, or model tuning for optimal performance.
